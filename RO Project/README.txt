CS7641 ML - Assignment 2 - Randomized Optimization

From this github (https://github.com/AlexMatthers/CS7641_Machine_Learning) download the contents of the 'RO Project' folder.
Ensure that Python 3.8 or higher is installed on the system.
Ensure that Python is in the system path and callable from the command line.
Ensure that the mlrose_hiive, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries are installed.

From the Command Line Interface navigate to the local location of the 'RO Project' directory.
The random optimizer comparison data is gathered by running the 'run_all_experiments.py' file.
    The graphs for this are generated by running 'Path_1_graphing.py' after the first file has finished running.
    The data and graphs are located in the 'Output' directory.
The Neural Network weight optimization is gathered and visualized by running the 'NNRunFaster.py' file.
    The data and graphs are located in the 'NNOutput' directory.
    
It should be noted that even with a very large number of CPU cores (>100) the running time for all data gathering exceeds 150 hours.

This code makes use of MLRose, SciKit-Learn, MatplotLib, Pandas, and Numpy.
